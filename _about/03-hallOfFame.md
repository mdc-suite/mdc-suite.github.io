**Carlo Sau** (_University of Cagliari_) -  He received his degree in Electronic Engineering in 2012 at the University of Cagliari and his PhD in 2016 in the same university. Since 2012, he workid on automated methodologies for dataflow-based reconfigurable platforms generation. His main contributions were related to reconfigurable system design and development of code generation tools for advanced reconfigurable hardware architectures.

**Tiziana Fanni** (_University of Sassari_) - She received her degree in Electronic Engineering in 2014 and her PhD in 2019 at the University of Cagliari. Since 2014 to September 2019 she stayed at Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering of the University of Cagliari, working on power saving methodologies for dataflow-based reconfigurable platforms since 2014. Her main contributions were related to reconfigurable systems design and development of code generation tools for low power reconfigurable hardware architectures.

**Claudio Rubattu** (_University of Sassari_) He received his degree in Electronic Engineering in 2015 at the University of Cagliari (Italy). After the graduation, Claudio joined the University of Cagliari EOLAB group to work embedded system design in bio-medical applications. Then he moved at the University of Sassari to work on the H2020 CERBERO project (http://www.cerbero-h2020.eu) on Smart Cyber Physical System Design and received his PhD on 2020 at the INSA Rennes. His main research focused on reconfigurable systems design and development of code generation tools for reconfigurable hardware/software architectures.
